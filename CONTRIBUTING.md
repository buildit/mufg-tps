Brief list of development requirements
--------------------------------------

Software
--------
- Use `nvm` (`brew install nvm`). Check the version of nodejs in play by catting `.nvmrc` in the root of the repo and installing with `nvm install VERSION`
- Use `yarn` (`brew install yarn`). Version should be at _least_ `1.16.0`
- Install `gatsby-cli` globally (`npm install -g gatsby-cli`). Only use `npm` for installing packages globally - use `yarn` within the confines of the repo.

Version Control
---------------
- Never push directly to `master` - create a PR from a branch for review.
- Branch names should be in the format `category/brief-description-of-branch-intent` (ex. `feature/add-some-more-cream`, `bug/fix-cream-overload`).
- Branch names should always be lowercase and use only hyphens to delimit words.
