## What is Supply Chain Finance
Today both Buyers and Suppliers look to reduce financing costs, improve working capital and free up liquidity in their cash conversion cycle.

Companies look to improve working capital by increasing or decreasing one of the levers in the cash conversion cycle equation. Some may look to minimize DIO or DSO by discounting their receivables, or increase DPO by holding onto cash longer and extending payment terms.
Supply Chain Finance offers access to economically-priced short-term funding.
 
## How Supply Chain Finance Works for You

1. A supplier sends goods/services to a buyer and submits an invoice
1. The buyer sends the approved invoice to MUFG
1. MUFG discounts the approved invoice and pays the supplier net proceeds
1. At invoice maturity date, the buyer pays the full approved invoice amount to MUFG
