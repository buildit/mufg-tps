### What is Supply Chain Finance?
Today both buyers and suppliers look to contain costs in their supply chain, improve working capital and free up liquidity in their cash conversion cycle.

Companies look to improve working capital by increasing or decreasing one of the levers in the cash conversion cycle equation. Some buyers may look to minimize DIO and DSO by discounting their receivables, or increase DPO by holding onto cash longer and extending payment terms.

Many suppliers look to accommodate their buyers without causing an impact on their cash flows and need access to economically priced short-term funding. 

No matter where you are or want to go with your cash conversion cycle, the strategic importance of financially sound buyers, customers and suppliers has an impact on working capital.
